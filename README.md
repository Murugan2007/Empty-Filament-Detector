# Empty-Filament-Detector
A project that detects when your 3D printer's filament goes out of stock, very basic and requires just a Micro-controller board,Buzzer,Hall sensor

Keep in mind that this uses a analog sensor and this one is a prime example of how you can use it, buy a cheaper and smaller factored board like Wemos D1 mini or Arduino nano too, don't use a Gigantic UNO tho
